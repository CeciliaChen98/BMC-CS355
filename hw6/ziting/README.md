# How to Use the Data Files and Disk Image

author: Ziting Shen

datafile-frag-data is a data file that you can compare to the one generated by your defragmentor. It is supposed to be the same as mine, althougn I haven't checked with anyone else. Please pm me if there're any doubts, questions, etc.

large-frag is a large disk image that can test your i2block and i3block. It's only large enough to use 1 direct block for i3block, yet I can make it bigger for you... Please meet me in person to get it as I cannot upload that to github. large-frag-data is the data file for it -- similarly, it hasn't been compared to anyone else's, so it is not necessarily correct.
