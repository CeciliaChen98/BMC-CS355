# How to Use the Data Files and Disk Image

author: Ziting Shen

datafile-frag-data is a data file that you can compare to the one generated by your defragmentor. It is supposed to be the same as mine, althougn I haven't checked with anyone else. Please pm me if there're any doubts, questions, etc.

large-frag is a large disk image that can test your i2block and i3block. It contains 1 inode that has 128 * 128 + 128 * 4 + 10 + 1 blocks. The file is basically an array of integers starting at 0 and incrementing by 1. It is stored contiguously, yet it starts by storing integers to the i2block, then to iblocks[by going backwards from the end to the start], then to dblocks[by going backwards from the end to the start], then to the i3block. (I really hope it could be arranged in a more elegant way, but this is the best I could do.) It's only large enough to use 1 direct block for i3block. (I can make it way bigger for you (~1GB). Please meet me in person to get it as I cannot upload that to github.) large-frag-data is the data file for it -- similarly, it is supposed to be the same if your defragmentor works reasonably, but it has not been compared to anyone else's and is not necessarily correct.
