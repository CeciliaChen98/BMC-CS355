Some code to generate a file with one inode that has the size specified by the DATA_REGION_SIZE pound defined value.
It stores the first data blocks starting at the end of the data region.  This really isn't tested that thoroughly and is very much use 
at your own risk, and I think I've found it generating incorrect files at various points.  

The data-file-defrag-data is the data output from Diana's file.  I couldn't upload the larger data files for the files Ziting created.  However my data outputs were the same as hers.
