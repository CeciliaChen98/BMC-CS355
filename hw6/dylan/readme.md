# Readme

Some code to generate a file with one inode that has the size specified by the DATA_REGION_SIZE pound defined value.
It stores the first data blocks starting at the end of the data region.  This really isn't tested that thoroughly and is very much use 
at your own risk.  You must be able to fit the file you're creating in memory.
