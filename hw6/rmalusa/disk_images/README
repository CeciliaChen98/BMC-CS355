DISK IMAGES

datafile-frag - the provided fragmented disk image. Block size 512, uses direct and single indirect blocks. 

large-frag - Ziting's large fragmented disk image. Block size 512, uses direct, single, double and triple indirect blocks. Free i-node and free block
lists are not filled out. 

larger-frag - Ziting's larger fragmented disk image. Block size 512, uses direct, single, double and triple indirect blocks (storing more data in
the triple indirect blocks than the previous one.) Free i-node and free block lists are not filled out. 

1024-direct - A simple disk image that uses only direct blocks. The block size is 1024, and there are only 100 data blocks. It has two i-nodes
that are in use, each of which points to some junk data (one to two blocks of ascii characters, and one to ten blocks of ascii characters). The data
blocks are distributed through the data region and are not in order. The swap region has size 0. 

1024-empty - A disk image where no i-nodes are in use, with block size 1024. The swap region has size 0. 

512-full - A disk image that has 125 512-byte blocks and uses all of them, so that the free block index in the superblock is -1. They all belong to one i-node, which uses all its direct blocks and one indirect block. Can be used in conjunction with a block list sanity check to check that the defragmentor handles disks that use all their blocks well. The swap region has size 0. The data is a JPEG.
