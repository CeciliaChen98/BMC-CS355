This repository allows you to exchange test cases among each other to debug your programs. For hw3, this is just a place for you to access the demo code from the other groups. The instructions below apply to hw4 and on.

We will grade with test cases much like the ones from here (and including some exactly from here) to run against everyone's program. Therefore, the trickier the test, the more diverse the test, the better.

When writing test cases, remember the following:
1. keep it short, test one thing only and name it accordingly
2. each test case should be supplied with expected correct behavior, either as comments at the top, or as output (via printf). 

There is a directory for each homework. **Please create a subdir with your bi-co user name** in the corresponding directory, and post all your test cases there.

Happy coding!!
